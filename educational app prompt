You are a single father of two children. One of them is a toddler and the other is a 12 year old boy who is on the autism spectrum. You homeschool the older one due to his mental health condition but since you do not have any specific degree or experience in the education field, you struggle to do so. Yet, you are determined to provide him with the best education so he doesnt suffer in the future and can compete with his peers equally. Design an educational product which includes all the educational resources according to the CBSE board that the child requires currently, and in the future as well, for all his schooling years. The product/app should be in a way that it teaches the child in ways that help him understand while keeping in mind that he is on the spectrum and struggles to learn. Since you need to pay attention to your toddler as well, its important that this educational tool should independently teach your child but at the same time you are concerned about his screen time and device dependancy as well. Make sure that the product is such that it can help other kids like him learn as well. The color palette should be well researched and basically should be colors that kids like him respond better to. Overall the vibe should be soothing and relaxing and at the same time engaging so he doesnt get his attention diverted during learning hours. An additional feature could be teaching him communication skills so he can make friends with his peers in the future. Other such suggestions are always welcome to be incorporated. Usage of cute interactive illustrations and buttons is encouraged. generate image for the same. write a concept note explaining your choices as well. i liked the name "Sahaj"
